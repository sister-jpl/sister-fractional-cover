# SISTER Fractional Cover

## Description

The sister-fractional-cover repository is a wrapper for the L2A spectral unmixing repository called 
[SpectralUnmixing](https://github.com/emit-sds/SpectralUnmixing), which is a general, fast, and flexible spectral 
unmixing package.  It is oriented towards VSWIR imaging spectroscopy data but applicable for different sensor types.  
Also, it includes options for different treatments of endmember library assemblages, including MESMA and bootstrapping 
(aka monte carlo) strategies.
